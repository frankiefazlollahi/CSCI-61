The first selection sort video of the Gypsy Folk Dance is algorithmically  incorrect. It modifies the
selection sort algorithm by swapping the values immediately after they are compared, instead of swapping after
going through the entire array. It is possible in the modified way to have multiple swaps in a single iteration
of the array when you should only have one swap, which occurs after you iterate through the entire array.
The correct way would be to keep track of the smallestValue, and as you iterate  through the array, if one
value is smaller than the current smallestValue, you set that new value to the smallestValue. Then once you
get to the end of the array, you swap the index of the smallestValue with the next index of the array that begins
at where all values after it (or before it if you are iterating backwards) are still unsorted.
